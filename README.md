# Bruno Albertoni - Portfolio

Hey there! This is my personal website that I'm currently working on. It's a portfolio where I showcase a bit about myself, my projects, and how to get in touch. The design is simple and responsive, and I'll be adding more content as I continue to build it out.

## What I'm Using

- **HTML5/CSS3/JS:** I havn't done webcoding in a while so I might be a little rusty.
- **Netfly:** for hosting, I use Netfly for another project too.

## How to View
