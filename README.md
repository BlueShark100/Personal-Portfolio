# Bruno Albertoni - Portfolio

Hey there! This is my personal website that I'm currently working on. It's a portfolio where I showcase a bit about myself, my projects, and how to get in touch. The design is simple and mobile-friendly, and I'll be adding more features as I continue to build it out.

## Features

- Responsive layout: Looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- About me: Quick intro about who I am and what I do.
- Projects: A section to show off the cool stuff I'm working on.
- Contact: Easy way for you to reach out.

## Tech I'm Using

- **HTML5:** I havn't coded in html in a while so I might be a little rusty.
- **CSS3:** for styling, including Flexbox for layout.
- **Netfly:** for hosting, I use Netfly for another project too.
